In December of 2019 I decided to rebuild my personal website. I wanted to have the typical home, about, and contact pages. I also wanted to have my own blog on this website. In addition, I wanted to be able to have a portfolio to feature some of my web development projects, and my online resume. As I researched the various ways to do this I decided to build my website using Gatsby.js, because it uses React.js.
I also wanted to be able to make updates to my blog post, portfolio, or resume without editing html. This is why I decided to use Contentful. With Contentful I can make updates or create new items using a web interface. Using GraphQL, I can pull in this content to display on my website.
